# Vagrant puppetserver

This is a centos 7.2 with the puppetserver ready to start in it.

## Servername: puppetmaster.example.com

The puppetserver service is started and ready to restart automatically after a 
```
$ vagrant halt
```

that causes the delay when you do your

```
$ vagrant up
```

for the first time.

We have added a slave (slave01) to connect to master. 


## Further dev

Update the treatement of the keys....
