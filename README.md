# Vagrant puppetserver

This is a centos 7.2 with the puppetserver ready to start in it.

## Servername: puppetmaster.example.com

Go ahead and run:

```
$ sudo systemctl start puppetserver
```

and you are ready to go.

Everything is ready to create a cluster setting the ips of each machine if you copy and edit the config block to add some hosts.
